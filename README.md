### /healt (GET)
Basic sanity check.

### /predict (POST)
Receives a list of passengers and predicts for each of them if theyâ€™re likely to survive or not. It also return the binary classifier used for the prediction. Here's a sample input:
```
[
    {"Age": 85, "Sex": "female", "Embarked": "C", "Pclass": 3},
    {"Age": 24, "Sex": "female", "Embarked": "C", "Pclass": 2},
    {"Age": 3,  "Sex": "male",   "Embarked": "C", "Pclass": 1},
    {"Age": 44, "Sex": "female", "Embarked": "Q", "Pclass": 3}
]
```

and sample output:
```
{
  "model": "Logistic",
  "predictions": [
    0,
    1,
    1,
    1
  ]
}
```
